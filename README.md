# SocialLearningPhenomena
The purpose of this simulation is to examine the effect of geographical distances on the formation of cultural differences through computational modelling. Great cultural differences have been observed in regions with greater geographical distances (Mausuda, Ellsworth, Mesquita, Leu, &van de Veerdonk, 2004), and similar ones have been observed in proximate regions (Dhawan, roseman, Naidu, Thapa & Rettek, 1995; Svani, Markus, & Conner, 2008). However, due to the limitation of human subjects and real social networks, there is a lack of proof for correlations between distance and cultural differences. Therefore, we introduced computational modelling into this problem. Three algorithms (Always Copy, Copy If Uncertain, and Approximate Majority) were used to regulate the transmission of beliefs between agents in social networks. In addition, the model of travelling probability was applied to capture the effect of geographical distances. As travelling probability increases, there will be less barriers for agents from different areas to communicate with each other and share beliefs. Through running the simulation, our model has revealed a strong positive correlation between geographical distances and the formation of cultural differences.
